# noPeacefulPlugin
This short & simple plugin for Spigot and Bukkit servers blocks users from executing `/difficulty peaceful` through the chat, console and command blocks.  

This prevents someone from accidentally causing mobs to despawn which can for example destroy farms using nametagged mobs.  


Download the .jar: https://github.com/3urobeat/noPeacefulPlugin/releases/latest  
...and put it into the `plugins` folder of your Spigot/Bukkit server. **Done!**  

This plugin was tested on 1.16 - 1.20 but should also work on other versions.
